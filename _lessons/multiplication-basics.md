why_important: |
  Multiplication is one of the fundamental operations in mathematics. Understanding 
  multiplication as repeated addition helps build a strong foundation for more 
  advanced math concepts like division, fractions, and area calculations. This 
  concept appears in everyday life when counting groups of objects, calculating 
  costs, and solving practical problems.
example: |
  **Example: 4 √ó 3 = ?**
  
  Think of this as "4 groups of 3" or "3 + 3 + 3 + 3"
  
  If you have 4 bags and each bag contains 3 apples:
  - Bag 1: üçéüçéüçé (3 apples)
  - Bag 2: üçéüçéüçé (3 apples)  
  - Bag 3: üçéüçéüçé (3 apples)
  - Bag 4: üçéüçéüçé (3 apples)
  
  Total apples = 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 12 apples
  So 4 √ó 3 = 12

  **Practice Problem:**
  
  Sarah has 5 boxes of crayons. Each box contains 6 crayons.
  
  1. Draw 5 boxes and put 6 crayons in each box
  2. Write this as an addition problem: ___ + ___ + ___ + ___ + ___ = ___
  3. Write this as a multiplication problem: ___ √ó ___ = ___
  4. How many crayons does Sarah have in total?
  
  **Answer:** 5 √ó 6 = 30 crayons
review: |
  **What we learned today:**
  - Multiplication is a shortcut for repeated addition
  - The first number tells us HOW MANY groups
  - The second number tells us HOW MANY in each group
  - We can draw pictures to help us visualize multiplication
  
  **Quick Check Questions:**
  1. What does 3 √ó 4 mean in words?
  2. Draw a picture to show 2 √ó 5
  3. Write 7 + 7 + 7 as a multiplication problem

## Lesson Introduction

Today we're going to learn about multiplication! Have you ever noticed that sometimes when we're adding, we add the same number over and over again? Like 2 + 2 + 2 + 2? Multiplication is a special shortcut that helps us add groups of the same number much faster.

Think about when you count your toys. If you have 3 boxes and each box has 4 toys, instead of counting every single toy, you can use multiplication to find out how many you have altogether!

## Understanding Multiplication as Groups

### What Does Multiplication Mean?

When we see 3 √ó 4, we can think of it in two ways:
- **3 groups of 4** (3 √ó 4)
- **4 groups of 3** (4 √ó 3)

Both give us the same answer: 12!

### Hands-On Activity: Making Groups

Let's use our counting objects to make groups:

1. **Start with 2 √ó 3:**
   - Make 2 groups
   - Put 3 objects in each group
   - Count all the objects: 6 total
   - Write: 2 √ó 3 = 6

2. **Try 3 √ó 2:**
   - Make 3 groups  
   - Put 2 objects in each group
   - Count all the objects: 6 total
   - Write: 3 √ó 2 = 6

Notice that 2 √ó 3 = 3 √ó 2! This is called the "commutative property."

## Building Multiplication Tables

### The 2 Times Table
Let's build the 2 times table using repeated addition:

- 1 √ó 2 = 2 (one group of 2)
- 2 √ó 2 = 2 + 2 = 4 (two groups of 2)
- 3 √ó 2 = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 (three groups of 2)
- 4 √ó 2 = 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8 (four groups of 2)
- 5 √ó 2 = 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 10 (five groups of 2)

### The 5 Times Table
The 5 times table is easy because it always ends in 0 or 5:

- 1 √ó 5 = 5
- 2 √ó 5 = 10
- 3 √ó 5 = 15
- 4 √ó 5 = 20
- 5 √ó 5 = 25

## Guided Practice

### Activity 1: Draw and Solve
Draw pictures to solve these problems:

1. 3 √ó 4 = ___
2. 2 √ó 6 = ___
3. 4 √ó 3 = ___

### Activity 2: Word Problems
Solve these real-life problems:

1. There are 4 tables in the classroom. Each table has 5 students. How many students are there?

2. Mom bought 3 packs of stickers. Each pack has 8 stickers. How many stickers did she buy?

## Independent Practice

Complete these multiplication problems. Remember to think about groups!

1. 2 √ó 7 = ___
2. 5 √ó 4 = ___
3. 3 √ó 6 = ___
4. 4 √ó 5 = ___
5. 6 √ó 2 = ___

**Challenge:** Can you write each problem as repeated addition too?

## Extension Activities

### Multiplication Stories
Create your own word problems using multiplication. Think about:
- Groups of animals
- Boxes of items
- Rows and columns of objects

### Multiplication Art
Use graph paper to create multiplication rectangles:
- Draw a 3 √ó 4 rectangle (3 rows, 4 columns)
- Color each square
- Count the total squares to find the answer

### Real-Life Multiplication Hunt
Look around your house for examples of multiplication:
- Egg cartons (2 √ó 6 = 12 eggs)
- Ice cube trays
- Muffin tins
- Windows with panes
