  Today's focus is on making connections between different subjects. 
  We'll use the plants from science in our writing, and incorporate 
  counting and grouping concepts from math into our nature observations.
  
  Weather looks nice - consider taking science lesson outside to the garden!
  
  If Simon seems restless, add extra movement breaks or incorporate
  kinesthetic learning activities.
